However, warning signs may include:\n\u25cf Frequent or recurrent infections (respiratory, gastrointestinal) beyond usual\n\u25cf Poor response to vaccines (measured by antibody levels in clinical settings)\n\u25cf In outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease (e.g., measles, whooping cough),\nunvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations experience higher rates of illness\nAdditionally, symptoms of vaccine-preventable diseases (fever, rash, cough, paralysis) are\nthe consequences of insufficient immunity or unvaccinated status.\nPrevention / Lifestyle\nImproving immunity and vaccination coverage includes:\n\u25cf Ensuring timely routine immunisations as per national schedules (infants,\nchildren, adolescents, adults). WHO emphasises full coverage of recommended\nvaccines\n\u25cf Adopting a healthy lifestyle to support immune function: balanced diet, adequate\nsleep, physical activity, avoiding smoking, controlling chronic disease\n\u25cf Community-level strategies such as vaccine-campaigns, outreach in remote areas,\neducation about vaccine safety & benefits. Public health emphasis is on both\nsupply (availability) and demand (community trust)\nScreening / Diagnosis\nAlthough there is no routine \"screening test for immunity\" for the general public, relevant\npractices include:\n\u25cf Checking immunisation records to ensure vaccines are up to date\n\u25cf In certain clinical settings (e.g., before travel, immunocompromised patients),\nserologic antibody testing may be used to confirm immunity (e.g., for hepatitis B,\nmeasles)\n\u25cf Outbreak surveillance and monitoring of vaccine-preventable diseases serve as\npopulation-level \"screening\" of coverage gaps\nManagement / Public Health Perspective\nFrom a public health viewpoint:\n\u25cf The WHO's Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) and Immunisation Agenda 2030\nset targets for vaccine coverage, equity, and innovation\n\u25cf Community outbreaks are managed by reinforcing vaccination campaigns, contact\ntracing, and targeted immunisation\n\u25cf Research continues into new vaccines (e.g., for malaria, HIV), improved\nadjuvants, and combination vaccines\n\u25cf Addressing vaccine hesitancy, supply chain issues, cold-chain logistics especially\nin low- and middle-income countries remains a core part of global strategies\nSuccessful immunisation programmes reduce disease burden, healthcare costs, and help\nbuild resilient health systems.\nSummary Points\n\u25cf Vaccination builds targeted immunity and protects individuals and communities\n\u25cf Healthy lifestyle supports immune function, though vaccines are the key tool for\nmany diseases\n\u25cf Public health programmes must address both access and trust to achieve high\ncoverage\n\u25cf Monitoring and innovation are ongoing in vaccine science and delivery\nDisclaimer: This document is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical\nadvice.\n"

The demographic shift towards increasing older populations globally makes\ngeriatric health a key public health focus.\nCauses / Risk Factors\nCommon risk factors for poor health in older age include:\n\u25cf The accumulation of cellular damage, chronic exposure to risk factors (smoking,\npoor diet, lack of exercise)\n\u25cf Multiple co-existing conditions (multimorbidity) and polypharmacy (use of\nmultiple medications) leading to interactions and adverse effects\n\u25cf Social determinants: isolation, poverty, inadequate access to healthcare, cognitive\ndecline, and reduced mobility\n\u25cf Age-related physiological changes: reduced immune function, slower metabolism,\ndecreased muscle mass (sarcopenia), sensory deficits\nSymptoms / Warning Signs\nIn older adults, warning signs include:\n\u25cf Unexpected weight loss, loss of appetite or mobility decline (may signal\nunderlying disease)\n\u25cf Memory loss, confusion, or changes in mental state (possible early dementia)\n\u25cf Repeated falls or fractures (indicate frailty or osteoporosis)\n\u25cf Persistent fatigue, breathlessness, or swelling (may signal cardiovascular,\npulmonary or renal disease)\nPrevention / Lifestyle\nPreventive lifestyle measures for older adults include:\n\u25cf Engaging in regular physical activity including strength/balance training to reduce\nfall risk and maintain muscle mass\n\u25cf Balanced nutrition with sufficient protein, calcium, vitamin D; avoiding\nmalnutrition or excessive caloric intake\n\u25cf Routine screenings and vaccinations (e.g., influenza, pneumococcus, shingles) as\nimmune function declines with age\n\u25cf Social engagement, mental stimulation, adequate sleep, and safe living\nenvironments to maintain cognitive and emotional well-being\nScreening / Diagnosis\nScreening and assessment in geriatric health may include:\n\u25cf Functional assessments (mobility, activities of daily living), cognitive screening\n(e.g., Mini-Cog), hearing/vision tests\n\u25cf Screening for chronic conditions: hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis (bone\ndensity), cancers\n\u25cf Review of medications for potential polypharmacy risks; assessment of fall risk\nand home safety\n\u25cf Loneliness, depression and social isolation screening to address psychosocial\ndeterminants\nManagement / Public Health Perspective\nFrom a public health standpoint:\n\u25cf Geriatrics emphasises person-centred care, coordination across disciplines\n(geriatricians, physiotherapists, social work)\n\u25cf Ageing and health strategies (WHO) focus on \"adding life to years\" rather than\nmerely \"years to life\"\n\u25cf Policies around healthy ageing, long-term care infrastructure, caregiver support,\nage-friendly environments are increasingly important as populations age\n\u25cf Research is addressing geriatric syndromes (frailty, dementia), and technological\ninnovations (tele-health, assistive devices) help support independence and reduce\nhealthcare burden\nSummary Points\n\u25cf Older adulthood comes with increased risk of multiple chronic conditions, but\nhealthy ageing and independence remain achievable\n\u25cf Prevention (exercise, nutrition, social connection) remains critical at older ages\n\u25cf Public health must shift to support ageing populations through age-friendly\nsystems and integrated care\nDisclaimer: This document is for educational purposes only and should not be considered medical\nadvice.\n"
